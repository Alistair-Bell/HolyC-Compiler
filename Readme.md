# Improved C compiler

This is a compiler project to learn some assembly and maybe make something I am proud of
The language being made is a modification of the C compiler in which I fix some issues I have with the language, small changes (quality of life)


```

i8 demo()
{
    return 1; 
}

demo; /* Program to run */

```
