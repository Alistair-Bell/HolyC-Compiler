HolyC Compiler Recreation

NOTICE:
The core of the compiler and other tools are on halt
I am working mainly on the assembly part of the project
Big update around the SDK and HolyStdLib will be out soon, this project is still being worked on

Aims to recreate the compiler and other HolyC tools found in the TempleOS operating system
